There is no singular definition to what DevOps entails. I will describe DevOps as a culture, 
a framework to create a bridge that joins developement and operations to ensure 
temas deploy their code to production environment seamlessly and faster in a repeatable
and automated way.

DevOps is more than just it tools, it involves principles, processes that aid the successfully 
delivery of projects or products through easier, efficient and faster means of deployment. DevOps is 
not Agile, but it agrees with Agile methodology that software features should be built and deployed as simpler parts or units.

Benefits of DevOps to a team
1. Lower the failure rate for new realeases.
2. Incresase deployment frequency.
3. Shorten lead time between fixes.
4. Achieve quick recovery from a new release after it crashes the aopplication.

Devops Lifecycle
This includes certain practices that should be adoption in a team to practice DevOps
* Continuous planning
* Collaborative development
* Continuous testing
* Continuous release and deployment
* Continuous monitoring

DevOps Principles
- Develop and test against a production-like environment.
- Deploying with reliable and repeatable processes.
- Monitor and validate operational quality.
- Amplify feedback loops

DevOps is the amalgamation of development and operations, which practices or responsibilties does unit have to make the establish DevOps in a team.

Development
1. Plan
2. Code
3. Build
4. Test

Operations
1. Relaease
2. Deploy
3. Monitor
4. Operate

It is understandable that present situation of the market dermands a cost efficency and speed to quicky deliver products. And engineers and operators finding it
difficult to ship smoothly as a result of chalenges facing from development to production phase. DevOps addresses or minimizing this issues by merging both development and operations
to collaborate, work efficiently and quick response to customer feedbacks.
